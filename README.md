# NDSN (Network Device Status Notifier)

NDSN is an application designed to monitor the status of devices on the network. When the device status changes, you can be notified via your Telegram bot. In addition, NDSN logs events to a csv file, which allows you to analyze past events using tools such as: pandas, MS Excel, LibreOffice Calc and others.
